# Email-Delete-for-G-Suite-Domain
## What is this?
This is a script to delete a single message from all the users in a G Suite (previously Google Apps) account using the Gmail and Admin Conslole APIs. 

## What do I need?
It's **IMPERATIVE** that the user that runs this, or tries to run it, be a Super Administrator on the account.
